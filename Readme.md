## Setup

- Update the `config` file to say your name.


## Usage

To make new notes for the day run:

This script will make a a new notes file for today and 
copy over any notes for in the "## Goals for other days this week or later" section.


## Todo items

- add in scripts to parse weekly notes into single result file
- option to specify file to write to??? See if you need this option?
- Maybe option for making meeting notes template??? maybe with google doc option (if I could figure out API)
